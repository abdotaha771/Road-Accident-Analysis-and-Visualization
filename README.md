# Road-Accident-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover insights and trends. The data cleaning and preparation were performed using Microsoft Excel, and the visualizations were created using Power BI. The goal is to provide a comprehensive view of road accident metrics to help identify areas for improvement.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- *Handling Missing Values*: Identified and managed missing values to ensure data completeness.
- *Removing Duplicates*: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
- *Data Transformation*: Standardized data formats and corrected inconsistencies.
- *Data Enrichment*: Added new calculated columns to enhance the dataset.
